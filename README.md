## 🍅 The Pomodoro Technique

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed in the late 80s by **Francesco Cirillo**. The theory behind this technique is that taking frequent breaks can help improve your mental focus and prevent burnout. This technique offers several benefits:

- **Improved mental agility** 🧠
- **Boosted motivation** 🚀
- **Better sense of accomplishment** ✅

It works by breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks, making it especially popular among programmers and students.

### How Does It Work?

The idea is to break down work into short intervals, typically:

- **25 minutes of focused work** 🕒
- **5 to 10 minutes of short breaks** ☕️

Each interval is called a **pomodoro** (Italian for "tomato"). The goal is to use each pomodoro to focus on one specific task, then take a break before moving on to the next one.
